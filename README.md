# Derived formats: Collections of Literary Texts

This repository contains collections of literary texts that are protected by copyright in a form that is suitable both for certain analytic procedures and does not infringe the full texts' copyright. 

Currently, the repository contains only one text collection, nicknamed "French-320". This is a balanced set of 320 French contemporary novels focused on two decades (1980s and 1990s) and four subgenres (sentimental novels, crime fiction, science fiction and high-brow novels), with 40 novels for each subgenre and decade. 

The principles, parameters, applications and limitations of these "derived text formats", inspired by initiatives such as the Google Ngram Corpus or the Hathi Trust's Extracted Features Dataset, are described in more detail in the following paper:
